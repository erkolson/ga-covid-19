## Georgia COVID-19 tracker

The GA State Department of Public Health publishes a [report](https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report) each day of
the confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the state.  The trends are more important
than any single day's report so this script scrapes the site, parses the
confirmed cases data, the county breakdown, and appends each result to
the relevant csv file.
